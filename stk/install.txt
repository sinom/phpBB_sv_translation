= The Support Toolkit =
The Support Toolkit (STK) was developed by the phpBB.com Support Team in
cooperation with EXreaction. The STK provides a second "Administration Control
Panel" that can be used to recover various part of a corrupted phpBB 3.0.x
installation or to solve commonly encountered problems with the software.

= Installation Instructions =
To install the Support Toolkit, upload the complete "stk" directory into your
forum's root directory on your server (the one containing a file named
"config.php"). Once you have uploaded the directory into the correct place,
point your browser towards the toolkit to access it (http://www.example.com/phpBB/stk/).
In the "contrib" folder you will find some additional installation instructions
(in the MODX format) which will allow you to better integrate the STK with your
phpBB installation.


= Translations =
The Support Toolkit is also available in multiple languages, to install your own
language pack first download the appropriate package from the STK page on
phpbb.com (http://www.phpbb.com/support/stk/). After that simply upload the
language folder to "stk/language/"


= Upgrade Instructions=
== Upgrade to 1.0.2.1-pl1 ==
To upgrade a previous version of the STK to 1.0.2.1-pl1, remove your previous
installation by deleting the stk/ directory, then follow the Installation
instructions above.
If you had any translations installed you'll have to reinstall these after the
update!
